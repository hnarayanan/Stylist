# Stylist

*Stylist* is a Django webapp that uses convolutional neural networks
for fast artistic style transfer. It is inspired by
[Prisma](http://prisma-ai.com).

This project is a work in progress, but I hope that it will look like
the following app when done:

with the following sort of image transformation.

Stylist serves as a fun practical example for me to better understand
how to train and serve neural networks at scale. If you'd like to
learn more about the theory underlying this project, you will find the
following interesting:
